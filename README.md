# What Is This Project?

This project is built to go along with the [todo-angular](https://github.com/jwjbadger/todo-angular) and [todo-backend](https://github.com/jwjbadger/todo-backend/). It is supposed to teach me about Flutter as a mobile development framework. A little while ago, I tried working with Xcode and Swift, I feel like this project will teach me about other approaches to developing for mobile (especially since Flutter is cross-platform). I want to try Flutter with both IOS, and Android in order to experience exactly the purpose of flutter. This will also teach me about linking mobile applications to a backend (something I have only done once, with Firestore).
