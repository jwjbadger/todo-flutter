# This Project

This project is built to go along with the [todo-angular](https://github.com/jwjbadger/todo-angular) and [todo-backend](https://github.com/jwjbadger/todo-backend/). It is supposed to teach me about Flutter as a mobile development framework. A little while ago, I tried working with Xcode and Swift, I feel like this project will teach me about other approaches to developing for mobile (especially since Flutter is cross-platform). I want to try Flutter with both IOS, and Android in order to experience exactly the purpose of flutter. This will also teach me about linking mobile applications to a backend (something I have only done once, with Firestore).

## Why Though?

A little while ago, I tried something very similar with flutter and a Python Flask API, but it did not turn out well. Part of the reason (I think) is that I somewhat followed a tutorial that didn't make much sense. However, I wanted to try this as it is a very 'beginner' app to make. This allowed me to learn a lot of new things that I was a beginner in, so I figured a todo app would be perfect.

## What Did I Learn?

For this section of the whole todo project, I learned just about flutter, and a bit of mobile app design. But, as a whole, I learned much more. I learned how to connect flutter with backend APIs and to design systems (somewhat). The whole todo project is a very good one that taught me quite a bit. I can't wait to try more with Flutter and Dart.

## Trying It Out

To try it out, first clone the repo with:
```git
git clone https://github.com/jwjbadger/todo-flutter.git
```

Next, install flutter, navigate to the project root folder, and type `flutter run` (Note: any device you want it on must be plugged into your computer, `flutter devices` will show you what devices you have, and IOS will only be able to try it on Mac due to Apple's rules). Note that you will have to change the `rootUrl` to the ip of whatever machine is running todo-backend inside *todo_service.dart* and *project_service.dart*.
